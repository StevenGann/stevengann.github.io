## Introduction

AI has been a passion of mine for a long time. Back in high school, I implemented neural networks to make 2D ragdolls learn to walk, control bots in games, and more. I was fascinated with the potential for AI to function like artificial life and was always playing with emergent behavior.

Fast forward to the age of LLMs, which were mind-blowing but I struggled to find a great use for generating text with a model that was limited to the contents of its training data. When I was introduced to [RAGs](https://stevengann.com/posts/RAGs-And-Agents/) everything clicked for me. I realized that modern AI had the potential to assist me and others like me in ways that nothing else ever has.


## My Problem and My Journey

I am... unique. Wired differently. I am incredibly forgetful, struggle to recall things when needed, forget people's names and information before they finish introducing themselves, etc. I tell my colleagues that if I don't get it in writing I will probably forget it, and I spend in-person meetings furiously typing notes so I don't lose key information or miss action items.

I've dealt with this for a long time. In college, I struggled to keep track of information like due dates and assignment details and would miss things that weren't communicated in text someplace. After watching the film [_Memento_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)) I was inspired to carry a small notepad with me and jot down key notes immediately after every conversation. I'd flip through all my notes a few times a day to refresh things, and would be relieved when I could tear out a page.

After college I tried to build my own [database for remembering things about people](https://github.com/StevenGann/PeopleDB), but my approach turned out to be unwieldy. I tried a "commonplace book", sticky notes everywhere, and a few different task tracker apps, but nothing fit quite right. I eventually landed on [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which has been my primary note-taking application since.

## Enter AI

I've been taking notes in Obsidian for over five years now, including everything from meeting notes, journal entries, notes on people, notes on things I do at work, notes on personal projects, study notes, whole articles and recipes I've copied into my vault, and more. It is all thoroughly organized, but there is still a whole lot of information to wade through. Basic search can only get me so far because I ultimately run into a fundamental problem: If I don't know it is in my notes, the notes can't help me.

When I learned about [RAGs](https://stevengann.com/posts/RAGs-And-Agents/), it occurred to me that my Obsidian vault was the perfect backing data source for a RAG. It contains pretty much everything I know that isn't common knowledge you'd find in an LLM. It has my ideas, my questions, and my answers. I immediately implemented a basic RAG that eventually grew into [VulcanAI](https://stevengann.com/posts/VulcanAI/), and have enjoyed having a private AI assistant I can chat with that has access to my second brain. When I encounter a problem at work I can quickly ask my AI about it and it might be able to point to some notes deep in my vault from another time I faced a similar problem, or it may even be able to infer something based on the sum total of information it has access to.

## My AI Assistant is Assistive Technology

For a lot of people, AI assistants are a novelty or just a trivial way of avoiding tedious little tasks. But for me, and people like me, an AI assistant is as valuable as spellcheck for [dyslexic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia) people or [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) for the blind or subtitles for the hearing impaired. I've started using wearables to bring the AI closer into my life, too: With a smartwatch and smart glasses, I have an AI assistant I can dictate notes and messages to, set and get reminders, take pictures of things for quick reference later, and even record conversations for reviewing later when I can't take notes.

Other AI infrastructure has been proving handy for me also. Online meetings can be transcribed but more recently they can even have AI-generated notes that capture action items and discussion topics better than a human taking minutes. I am awash in e-mails and chat messages at work, but with AI tools I can have a daily briefing generated every morning so I can find where I left off the previous day instead of just dropping the ball. More and more, AI is helping take some of the cognitive burden and compensate for my faulty memory so I can focus on work that matters.

## Anti-AI Sentiment and Stigma

Unfortunately, AI has become a very divisive topic. This is certainly understandable and there's a lot of very valid issues to be dealt with regarding how modern AI is trained, deployed, and used. From environmental concerns to ethical problems to intellectual property rights. Unfortunately, these issues have led many to be opposed to AI in general, regardless of how it is being used.

I make an effort to talk about how AI is helping me function in an increasingly challenging world in hopes that the anti-AI crowd might open their minds to think that maybe _some_ AI isn't so bad.
