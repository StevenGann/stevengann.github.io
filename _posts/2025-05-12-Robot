I've been fascinated with robots for as long as I can remember, and I was building robots since I was a kid. I had Lego Mindstorms and competed in the FIRST Lego League, I got a Parallax BOEbot kit and programmed it to do all sorts of things in BASIC. In college I repurposed the chassis to add a CMU Cam module and an ultrasonic distance sensor on a pan/tilt assembly and controlled the whole thing with a Raspberry Pi. At some point, that robot got disassembled and rebuilt into a simpler remote controlled robot with a claw on it, a one-day project to prepare a STEM demo for some children who would be visiting the university for a science fair.
