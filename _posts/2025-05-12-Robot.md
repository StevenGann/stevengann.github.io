This is the first post about the Mite project and my first post on this blog about a robot so it will start with some introduction.

## Backstory

I've been fascinated with robots for as long as I can remember, and I was building robots since I was a kid. I had Lego Mindstorms and competed in the FIRST Lego League, I got a Parallax BOEbot kit and programmed it to do all sorts of things in BASIC. In college I repurposed the chassis to add a CMU Cam module and an ultrasonic distance sensor on a pan/tilt assembly and controlled the whole thing with a Raspberry Pi. At some point, that robot got disassembled and rebuilt into a simpler remote controlled robot with a claw on it, a one-day project to prepare a STEM demo for some children who would be visiting the university for a science fair.

My robot projects effectively paused until around 2022 when my father and I started building a new robot with a 3D printed frame and four independantly-controlled wheels, LIDAR, RADAR, a camera with pan/tilt and incredible optical zoom, and a whole lot more. Unfortunately that robot project is on hold pending some design challenges and I started this project so I could work on the software elements in the meantime. That other robot will be posted here eventually.

## The Mite

I named it Mite because my objective was to make a minimal, compact robot with simple mechanics to serve as a test bed for the software and AI I want to prototype. This meant starting with an old generic 2WD robot kit I'd had paying around since college. It is the ubiquitous round 2WD turtle-style chassis made from black sheet metal, yellow wheels, and yellow gear motors. The kit as I found it featured a [Romeo control board](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-656.html) which is basically an old fashioned Ardunio Uno clone with convenient headers for servos and analog sensors as well as a full H-bridge. From here I started making a plan for the hardware and software.

**Hardware:**

- 2WD turtle chassis
- Romeo board handling DC motor control and servos
- Raspberry Pi handling communications and sensors
- LD06 LIDAR
- A010 depth camera
- Raspberry Pi camera
- Servos with pan-tilt to aim the LIDAR and cameras

**Software:**

- Arduino sketch for the Romeo board
- Control program for the Raspberry Pi
- Dashboard/Server program for the AI workstation
- SLAM for navigation
- Point cloud collection for mesh reconstruction offline
- Multi-modal AI agent to control the robot

Unsurprisingly, half the motivation behind this project is to use my [VulcanAI](https://stevengann.com/posts/VulcanAI/) project to allow a self-hosted agentic AI to control the robot, but that will require a lot of infrastructure first.

## Firmware

The first step was to get the Romeo board up and running to control the rover's motors and eventually the servos too. I had played with this chassis and board in college so I knew it was pretty simple to get working, but I was curious how well [AI would handle the task](https://stevengann.com/posts/Vibe-Coding/). I fed the Arduino and Romeo documentation to Cursor and gave it a thorough description of what I needed. To summarize, I wanted it to accept commands over UART and decode them to set the motors and servos. Cursor spat out some very straight-forward Arduino code that did exactly what I needed. Not micro-optimized or terse, but not spaghetti code either. Considering Arduino was designed for students, hobbyists, and rapid prototyping, I am not surprised but still pleased with how well it worked. For something so simple and tedious, it is nice to offload the boilerplate to automation.

## Software

Next came the code for the Raspberry Pi. Because I am lazy I wanted the software to be cross-platform and run on my Windows workstation, Linux laptop, and Raspberry Pi equally well. Since the more elaborate sensors like LIDAR and cameras are all USB, it is convenient to test them directly on the system I am coding on.
