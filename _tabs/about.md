My name is **Steven Gann** and I am a Hardware Validation Engineer at **NVIDIA**, where I work on developing and validating compute platforms for datacenter applications. My expertise lies at the intersection of hardware and software, with a particular focus on **embedded systems** and **hardware validation**. With a background in Computer Engineering from Florida Atlantic University, I've spent my career pushing the boundaries of technology. At NVIDIA, I work with cutting-edge GPU families like Hopper and Blackwell, while my previous roles at **Microchip Technology** and **Logus Microwave** have given me extensive experience in embedded systems, memory products, aerospace designs, and RF technology. I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between hardware and software. My work spans from developing evaluation kits and demonstration platforms to implementing complex validation systems for high-performance computing platforms.

When I'm not working on hardware validation or embedded systems, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and exploring new technologies in the fields of AI, IoT, and real-time systems.
